Example description
===================
The USB Audio Speaker demo gives examples of how to use the STR9 USB
peripheral to communicate with the PC host in the isochronous transfer mode.
It provides a demonstration of the correct method for configuring an isochronous
OUT endpoint, receiving data from the host and the in DMA unlinked mode.

More details about this Demo implementation is given in the User manual 
"UM0290 STR7/STR9 USB developer kit V2.0", available for download from the ST
microcontrollers website.


Directory contents
==================
 + \include: contains the Demo firmware header files
 + \project: contains pre-configured projects for RVMDK, EWARM5, RIDE and HiTOP 
    toolchains
 + \source: contains the Demo firmware source files


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STR91x evaluation boards and can be 
easily tailored to any other hardware.
