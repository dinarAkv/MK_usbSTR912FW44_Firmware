* V2.0.0 - 09/29/2008
=====================

General
*******
   + Update the kit with the with STR71x Firmaware library V4.0 and the STR91x 
     Firmware library V 2.0.
   + Add the Support of RIDE and HiTOP toolchains.
   + Replace the RVDK by Keil toolchain.

< USB library >
***************
   + Correct the bug of control transfer when the data to transfer is an exact 
     multiple of wMaxPacketSize for the endpoint. In this case the device should
     return a zero-length packet to indicate the end of the Data stage. 
     For more details regarding this condition please refer to the section 
     8.5.3.2 of the USB 2.0 specification.
          
     The functions DataStageIn() and Data_Setup0() in the file "usb_core.c" are 
     modified to support this feature.   

   + Correct the Get Status request (bus/self power feature reporting): function 
     Standard_GetStatus(u16 Length) in the usb_core.c updated.

   + update the function UserToPMABufferCopy (file usb_mem) to avoid any problem 
     with non aligned data access.

< USB demos >
************* 
   + All demos
      
       - first plug bug: in the first plug on a new PC, Windows sends a specific 
         Get string descriptor (OS descriptor index 0xEE). This descriptor is not 
         supported by the demos so the function "GetStringDescriptor(u16 Length)"
         is modified to STALL all Get string descriptor requests with an index 
         greater than the number of supported string descriptors(file usb_prop.c). 
         
       - the infinite loop in the USB initialization is removed to be compliant 
          with embeded OSs (file usb_prop.c)
          
       - update the "bDeviceState" possible values (file usb_pwr.h) to be:
          - UNCONNECTED
          - ATTACHED
          - POWERED
          - SUSPENDED
          - ADDRESSED
          - CONFIGURED
          
         The "bDeviceState" is updated according to the device state in the files 
         usb_prop.c and hw_config.c
         
       - current feature initialization: the field "pInformation->Current_Feature" 
        is initialized on each USB reset (file usb_prop.c).        
      
       - update all device and configuration descriptors to be USB 2.0 complient.  
       
              
   + Add a CUSTOM_HID demo with PC applet (source code porvided) to give an 
   example of how to create a customized HID device based on windows native 
   driver.


   + Device_Firmware_Upgrade demo
      - Add example with preconfigured projects for RVMDK, EWARMv5, RIDE and 
        HiTOP toolchain to demonstrate how to create a binary image to be loaded
        with the DFU 
  
* V1.0 - 10/01/2006
====================
  Created.
