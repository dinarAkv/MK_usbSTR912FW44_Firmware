# MK_usbSTR912FW44_Firmware
This repository contain example of firmware for usb peripheral as virtual com port.
Firmware has tasted on microcontroller STR912FW44. 

Firmware programmed on the base of example rendered by STMicroelectronics.

###How to work firmware.

When user from host through terminal send message (sequence of bytes,
for example: 0xFF 0xFE 0xFD) to device (STR912FW44). After device received message it callback this message
to the host. So user get the same message in the host terminal.




###Firmware code wrote with help of Keil IDE.
